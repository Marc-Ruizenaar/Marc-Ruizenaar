Hi everyone, I'm Marc Ruizenaar! I'm a student at Hyper Island, currently studying to become a front-end developer. Alongside my passion for coding, I have a love for windsurfing and wakeboarding. If Iâ€™m not behind a screen, you can find me around a lake or the sea.

Before diving into web development, I worked as a designer (mainly packaging design). To me, building a website is a lot like designing a carton box. Instead of folding it into shape, you're building different pages, making sure everything fits together seamlessly for the best experience.
